# National Team Analytical System
## Description
This project is a complete analytical system for football data. It provides insights at multiple levels, including tournament, team, and player statistics. Users can analyze historical data using interactive dashboards with filters, drill-downs, and visualizations for overall, home, and away matches, as well as head-to-head and player comparisons.

## Main Features
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation**: Cleaning the dataset, handling missing or inconsistent values, and adding calculated columns for analysis.
- **ETL with SSIS**: Extract, Transform, and Load processes using SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) to move and prepare data from Excel files to SQL Server.
- **Data Warehousing**: Building a data warehouse with dimensions and fact tables to structure the data efficiently.
- **Interactive Dashboards & Charts**: Creating visualizations to explore teams, tournaments, and player performance.
- **Drill-down Analysis**: Drill-down by Continent, Region, and Ethnic Group for hierarchical insights.
- **Head-to-Head Comparisons**: Compare teams based on historical matches, including wins, losses, goals, and clean sheets.
- **Player Performance Analysis**: Analyze individual player statistics, including goals, penalties, own goals, and home/away performance.

## Technologies Used
- **SQL Server**: For database management and data warehousing.
- **SSIS (SQL Server Integration Services)**: For ETL processes to move and transform data from Excel to SQL Server.
- **Power BI**: For interactive dashboards and visualizations.
- **DAX & DAX Studio**: For creating measures, performing calculations, and validating ETL data within Power BI.

## Conclusion
This project delivers a **complete analytical system** for football data, providing full insights into national teams and their historical performance. It enables users to understand participating teams and examine all statistics for any national team throughout history.
